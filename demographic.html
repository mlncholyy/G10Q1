   <hr>
   <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;">The reason why our viewers need to understand the impact of online gaming on high school students' social skills and interpersonal relationships is to help students between Junior and Senior High School navigate the balance between their online gaming habits and their personal growth. Our stream will provide insights into how excessive gaming can influence their ability to communicate effectively, build meaningful relationships, and develop essential social skills, both online and offline. Understanding these dynamics will allow students, parents, and educators to make informed decisions about screen time, fostering healthier social interactions that prepare them for real-world scenarios and future success in life.

                People from different ages, statuses, and beliefs watch streams based on a variety of factors, including the desire for personalized, interactive content, the convenience of on-demand viewing, and the appeal of niche interests or communities that resonate with their values. While younger generations, such as Gen Z, prefer highly personalized, social media-driven content that reflects their digital-native lifestyle, older generations have also adapted to streaming habits, often drawn by the flexibility and tailored experiences that fit their schedules and interests. Across all demographics, the ability to connect with content creators and communities in real-time adds a layer of engagement and loyalty that traditional media struggles to replicate.
